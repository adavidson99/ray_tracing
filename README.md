# ray_tracing
A scene displaying ray tracing using C++ and OpenGL

## Features
The ray tracer displays a total of 8 various objects resting on a floor. These objects
include 4 spheres, a pyramid, a cone, and 2 cylinders. The largest sphere is red and
reflective, and is located centrally. There are other 2 spheres to the either side of this
central sphere. The one to the left is transparent and partly solid, and thus has a
refractive index of 1.02 and distorts light. The one to the right is transparent green and
is completely hollow, and thus doesnâ€™t refract light. The final sphere is a smaller one
also located centrally but closer to the camera. This sphere is texture mapped using an
image of a butterfly.
